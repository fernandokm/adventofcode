# [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) 
Solutions to *advent of code* in python3. Each code file is self-contained and requires only the appropriate inputs, taken from the files in *inputs/...*

The command
```
./run <file>
```
will run `file` with the correct input (e.g. `run day1` will run *./day1* with input taken from *inputs/day1*). Input is given through command line arguments. The special case
```
./run -A
```
will run all solution files.
